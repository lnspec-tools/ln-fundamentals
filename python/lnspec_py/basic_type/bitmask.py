This file includes the definition of the bitmask definition and gives the possibility to encode and decode
 the array of value in and from hex

But before WHAT IS A BITFIELD?
 - an encoding of integer in as bitmask.

What is a bitmask?

From Stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/a/31576303/10854225)

bitmask is: It is just a number, as represented in binary.
For example, let's say I have 8 boolean values (true or false)
that I want to store. I could store it as an array of 8 booleans, or I could store it as a single byte (8 bits),
each of which store one of the booleans (0 = false, 1 = true).

At this point, I can easily manipulate my byte so that I can (1) set specific bits to be on or off (true or false),
and (2) check whether specific bits are on or off.

To set a bit to 1: mask = mask | (1 << bitIndex)
To set a bit to 0: mask = mask & ~(1 << bitIndex)
To get a bit (to be able to check it): (mask & (1 << bitIndex)) != 0

All of these operations use the left-shift operator, which moves bits up from least-significant
to most-significant positions.
