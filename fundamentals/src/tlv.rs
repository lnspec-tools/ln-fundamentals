//! Rust implementation for the Type Length Value Encoding.
//!
//! Within communication protocols, TLV (type-length-value or tag-length-value)
//! is an encoding scheme used for optional informational elements
//! in a certain protocol.
//!
//! A TLV-encoded data stream contains code related to the record type,
//! the record value's length, and finally the value itself.
//!
//! Details
//! The type and length are fixed in size (typically 1â€“4 bytes), and the value field is of variable size. These fields are used as follows:
//!
//! Type
//!
//! A binary code, often simply alphanumeric, which indicates the kind of field that this part of the message represents;
//!
//! Length
//! The size of the value field (typically in bytes);
//!
//! Value
//! Variable-sized series of bytes which contains data for this part of the message.
//!
//! Some advantages of using a TLV representation data system solution are:
//!
//! - TLV sequences are easily searched using generalized parsing functions;
//! - New message elements which are received at an older node can be safely skipped and the rest
//! of the message can be parsed. This is similar to the way that unknown XML tags can be safely skipped;
//! - TLV elements can be placed in any order inside the message body;
//! - TLV elements are typically used in a binary format and binary protocols which
//! makes parsing faster and the data smaller than in comparable text based protocols.
